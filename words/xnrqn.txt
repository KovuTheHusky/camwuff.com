█████

█████ holding thousands of dollars of my belongings hostage and is refusing to give them back because I reported ████ for assaulting me

I don't know what to do

I'm going to have to do civil suits

I have a lawyer in Maine willing to do pro bono work for me as this is domestic violence related

I'm going to have to make this a huge deal if they can't work with me

This is really shit
