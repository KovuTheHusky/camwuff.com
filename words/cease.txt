Dear █████ ███████,

I am writing to demand that you immediately cease and desist from engaging in defamatory actions, false claims regarding copyright, wrongful eviction, and breaches of confidentiality. Your recent actions have not only caused significant personal distress but also legal harm, and they must stop immediately.

Defamation:

It has come to my attention that you have been making false statements to silence me and delegitimize my claims regarding the assault by ████ and, in the future, your husband █████ ███████. Specifically:

1. You have falsely claimed that I do not have copyright claims to the photographs I took at Furcationland and other events, which are my own intellectual property.
2. You have lied to board members of Furcationland and others, falsely stating that I have not paid my rent after you illegally evicted me from our shared apartment, despite my name being on the lease.
3. You have made numerous false claims to those we are both associated with to damage my reputation before I am able to make statements on my assault claims. These claims will be thoroughly reviewed for slander.

These actions constitute defamation, as defined under Maine Revised Statutes Title 14, §556. False statements made with the intent to harm my reputation and discredit my valid claims are not only unethical but also illegal.

Copyright Infringement:

As the creator of the photographs used to promote Furcationland, I hold the copyright to these works under the Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.). Your false claims regarding my lack of copyright ownership are not only defamatory but also constitute an infringement on my intellectual property rights, potentially subjecting you to liability for statutory damages and attorneys' fees under 17 U.S.C. § 504 and § 505.

Wrongful Eviction:

Your actions in evicting me from our shared apartment without due process, despite my name being on the lease, are illegal under New York State and New York City landlord-tenant laws. New York law requires proper notice and legal proceedings for eviction, and your failure to follow these procedures constitutes wrongful eviction, exposing you to potential civil liability for damages. Specifically:

1. New York State Real Property Law § 853: Provides for treble damages for unlawful eviction.
2. New York City Administrative Code § 26-521: Prohibits unlawful eviction and may result in civil penalties and other legal consequences.

Breach of Confidentiality:

It has come to my attention that you informed ████ immediately of my report to Furcationland regarding the sexual assault. This breach of confidentiality has not only put me at further risk but also constitutes a serious violation of my privacy and safety. Your actions in leaking this information violate numerous privacy laws and will result in additional legal consequences.

Privacy Laws Violated:

1. Invasion of Privacy: Under common law principles, the unauthorized disclosure of private facts about an individual can constitute an invasion of privacy. By informing ████ of my report, you have disclosed sensitive information without my consent, thereby invading my privacy.
2. Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress: The unauthorized disclosure of my report and the subsequent actions have caused me significant emotional distress. Under New York law, actions causing severe emotional distress through negligence can result in liability.
3. Breach of Fiduciary Duty: As a representative of Furcationland, you have a fiduciary duty to protect the confidentiality and safety of volunteers. Your disclosure of my private information to ████ breaches this duty and exposes you to legal consequences.

Severe Emotional Distress:

As a result of your actions, I have suffered extreme emotional distress, including instances of self-harm and suicide attempts, which you are well aware of. Your actions have not only violated my privacy and legal rights but have also significantly endangered my mental and physical well-being.

Tampering with Evidence:

It has come to my attention that you tampered with and deleted numerous Telegram chats
regarding ████, the sexual assault against me from ████, your infidelity with ████, and
quid-pro-quo allegations with ████. You selectively left in messages that made you appear
justifiable in arguments without the full context. This was done after you informed ████ of my
intention to come forward with the sexual assault report. Tampering with evidence in this
manner is both unethical and illegal, further compromising the integrity of the investigation and
your credibility. Specifically:

1. Maine Revised Statutes Title 17-A, §456: Tampering with public records or information, which includes altering, destroying, concealing, removing, or otherwise impairing the verity or availability of any record, document, or thing with the intent to deceive or injure.
2. Maine Revised Statutes Title 17-A, §457: Tampering with a witness, informant, juror, or victim, which includes any attempt to induce another person to testify falsely, withhold testimony, or provide false information.
3. Maine Revised Statutes Title 17-A, §451: Hindering apprehension or prosecution, which includes destroying, concealing, or altering any evidence with the intent to impair its availability in an official proceeding.

Failure to Return Belongings:

Additionally, a month has gone by without you returning thousands of dollars' worth of my personal belongings. These need to be returned immediately, especially considering you do not have legal grounds to withhold them and are not employed.

Demand for Immediate Action:

1. Cease and Desist Defamation: You must immediately cease making any and all false and defamatory statements about me. This includes stopping any further communication of these false claims to board members, other volunteers, or any third parties.
2. Public Retraction: I demand a public retraction of all false statements you have made about me or lied about your affair and assault against me from ████, including the false claims regarding copyright and rent payment. This retraction should be communicated to all parties to whom you have previously made the false statements.
3. Copyright Acknowledgment: You must acknowledge my copyright ownership of the photographs taken by me at Furcationland or any I have taken, and cease any further false claims regarding this matter.
4. Reinstatement and Compensation: I demand that you address the wrongful eviction by either reinstating my residence in the apartment or compensating me for the illegal eviction and any associated damages.
5. Breach of Confidentiality: You must cease any further breaches of confidentiality and take steps to ensure that my privacy and safety are protected going forward.

Legal Consequences:

If you do not comply with these demands within five (5) days from the date of this letter, I will have no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies. This includes, but is not limited to, filing a lawsuit for defamation, copyright infringement, wrongful eviction, breach of confidentiality, invasion of privacy, negligent infliction of emotional distress, breach of fiduciary duty, and any other applicable claims. I will also seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees and costs.

Please be advised that continued defamatory actions, false claims, and breaches of confidentiality will not be tolerated and will be met with the full force of the law. This is your final warning to cease and desist all unlawful activities immediately.

Sincerely,

███████ ██████████ ███
