hey :)

how have you been?

I'm doing alright just got my suit in the mail today which is nice. :)

I moved back to Pennsylvania which is not so nice

yeah allot of things went downhill badly

I found out ████ would rape his dog and that caused allot of problems between us all as I was the only one that had an issue with it

He then assaulted me at ANE over it just went completely nuts and ripped half my hair out and had me bruised and bloody

We went to a couples therapy over a bunch but neither of them really felt bad and when they realized I would talk about it so they illegally evicted me

I would watch him staring at his dogs dick when they would play

And I confronted ████ how that wasn't right and then he told me himself

He broke up with me, instantly called the cops and they put me in a psychward because they thought I was going to kill myself

The second I got out they had all my shit packed it was traumatizing

This was like a month ago

I've been in York for about a month now

I couldn't keep my job in NYC living out of my car I didn't really have a choice

Life took a downgrade lol I'm just delivery driving now I was making 80k

There's allot I'm not going to talk about to anyone because it's remarkably embarrassing and looks bad on my end the amount I put up with

Just trying to move on at this point I was looking for stability being with them and that is not what I found

I lost my best friend and I'm back to square one again, I did not expect my future to be this way but I suppose I only did it to myself

████ despised me after he assaulted me and would do everything he could to cause conflict

If ████ would do something with me, ████ would need to one up it or complain about it

He would throw my belongings, slam doors in my face and just make as many micro aggressions as humanly possible

There was a very weird dynamic where ████ could get away with anything because of the money he made and ████ would refuse to acknowledge any of it

There was also an issue with cheating, first ████ cheated a bunch which is why we broke up, and then ████ cheated 3 times which I feel is as a result of ████ cheating

I also cheated towards the end of things which was terrible on my part but ████ didn't care too much, a way different situation than them though

It was but we would put rules in place, and then they would break them

Mhm you can

Koix is who I cheated on and he hates me because I didn't leave that relationship


I'm suing him and getting his husband charged

Yes

████ does a thing where he only actively talks to people who reciprocate horniness and when you don't do that he doesn't talk to you
