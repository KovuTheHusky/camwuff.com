he cheats lies steals and hides multiple assaults

when you tell the truth how they treated you and now you're the bad person

for the zoophile supporters abusers and fakes that are out of my life

can't remember how to say your name anytime anyone mentions you I get irrationally upset at how much you got away with and how you're able to live a normal life while I'm here stuck with the trauma

you cheated and left me for the person who sexually assaulted me volunteering at your convention and brought me back to poverty you wonder why I'm bitter

love isn't when I made excuses and defended you for the way you acted towards me because I thought I loved you

love is when I finally opened my eyes and stopped making excuses and saw the real you, I accepted it
